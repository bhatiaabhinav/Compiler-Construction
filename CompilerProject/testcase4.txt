# line 9: matrix addition is between matrices of incompatible sizes.
# you can also use the same test case to print the sizes of the matrices
# mat1 and mat2. Remember that you populate the symbol table with type info
# for variables mat1, mat2 and m while traversing sub trees corresponding 
# to lines 2 and 3 and 5 and 6.
